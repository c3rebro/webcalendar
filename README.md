# webcalendar

* ***What does it do?*** With the event calendar you can save events in a DB table (SQLite database file). The events are clearly displayed in a calendar. Navigation of the calendar is completely via JavaScript (Ajax), so no page changes are necessary. The calendar shows all the days of a month in the form of an HTML table. Buttons can be used to navigate to the previous month / previous year or the coming month / year. Events can be entered directly in the calendar (edit, move, copy or delete).
* ***Why is it useful?*** No installation or container environments needed. The requirements are just php 7 or up. Works with local sqlite_3 php extension.
* ***Which browsers are supported?*** Chrome, Firefox, LibreWolf, Opera, Opera GX, Edge, Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, and Safari.
